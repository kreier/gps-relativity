        "# Relative time for GPS satellites\n",
        "\n",
        "GPS satellites experience both gravitational time dilation (due to being farther from Earth's gravitational field compared to ground stations) and special relativistic time dilation (due to their high orbital velocity). Let's break it down:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Gravitational Time Dilation:** The satellite's clock runs *faster* because it's farther from Earth’s gravitational field. This causes its clock to gain about **+45.7 microseconds** per day relative to a clock on the ground.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Special Relativistic Time Dilation:** Due to the satellite's orbital speed (around 14,000 km/h), its clock runs *slower*. This effect leads to a loss of about **−7.2 microseconds** per day.\n",
        "\n",
        "When we combine these effects, the net result is that the satellite clock runs about **+38.5 microseconds faster per day** compared to a clock on Earth.\n",
        "\n",
        "Although this seems tiny, it’s a critical adjustment—GPS systems have to account for this difference to maintain precise timing, as even a small error can lead to significant inaccuracies in positioning."
